## Summary and Reflection

I designed a responsive user profile page using flutter which showcase the user information, education and project details. This is implemented using Row, column, and card widgets and some other widgets to make clean and visual appealing. The model files are used to embed the static data into the UI. The mediaquery is incorporated to adjust the layout based on screen sizes. Overall i tried to created an app which satisfy the requirement and user friendly experience.

I enjoy throught designs in building app and faced some layout issues while doing as responsive one across various screen sizes
